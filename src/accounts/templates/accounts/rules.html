        <td><b>How points system works?</b></td>
        <td> When you choose a side in a match, you‚Äôre essentially betting against everyone who picked the opposing side. Here‚Äôs how the scoring system works:
The point value for the match (let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúPV‚Äù) is predetermined (e.g., PV = 1 for one match and PV = 2 for another. Refer Point Value section for more details). If your selected team wins the match, you earn points equal to the product of the point value (PV) and the number of opponents who chose the other side. Conversely, if your selected team loses, you lose the same amount of points (negative PV * number of opponents).
<br>For example, consider a match between Team A and Team B with a point value of 1. Player X and Y choose Team A, while Player Z selects Team B. If Team A wins, both X and Y earn 1 point each, while Z loses 2 points (-2). Conversely, if Team B wins, X and Y lose 1 point each, and Z gains 2 points (+2).
<br>In another example, let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs a match between Team C and Team D with a point value of 2. Player X chooses Team C, and Players Y and Z choose Team D. If Team C wins, X earns 4 points (2 * 2 opponents), while Y and Z each lose 2 points (-2). On the other hand, if Team D wins, Y and Z each gain 2 points (+2), and X loses 4 points (-4).
<br>In the event of a tie or no results, no points are gained or lost. If no bet is selected, it means you‚Äôre skipping the bet, and the outcome of the match will have no effect on your points. Additionally, if all players pick the same side (i.e., no one is betting against each other), the match outcome will also have no impact on points.
Participants can view their aggregated points on the leaderboard screen.</td>

    <tr>
        <td><b>Tie breaker</b></td>
        <td>In the event that two or more players are tied with the same total points, a tiebreaker will be applied. The first tiebreaker considers the number of skipped bets, with the player having fewer skipped bets being declared the winner. If the tie persists, the next criterion is the number of matches won. Should the tie still remain, the players who tied will be declared joint winners. üèÜ
